# Flutter Project

## Overview
This project is a Flutter application organized using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Clean Architecture principles. This structure promotes a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase by separating concerns and enhancing code reuse.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose according to MVVM and Clean Architecture principles. Below is an overview of the key directories and their roles:

### MVVM Architecture
1. **Model**
    - Contains the data representation and business logic of the application, including data models and classes that interact directly with data sources.
    - **Example**: `lib/models/user.dart`, `lib/models/repository.dart`

2. **View**
    - Comprises UI components such as widgets, screens, and layouts. This layer is responsible for rendering data received from the ViewModel and handling user interactions.
    - **Example**: `lib/views/user_screen.dart`, `lib/views/login_screen.dart`

3. **ViewModel**
    - Acts as a bridge between the View and Model layers. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it if necessary, and exposes it to the View. ViewModels also handle lifecycle-aware components.
    - **Example**: `lib/viewmodels/user_viewmodel.dart`, `lib/viewmodels/auth_viewmodel.dart`

### Clean Architecture
1. **Domain**
    - Represents the core of the application, containing business logic and rules. This layer is independent of any other layers, ensuring that business rules can be tested without relying on external components.
    - **Components**: Use cases, business models, interfaces for repositories
    - **Example**: `lib/domain/usecases/get_user_usecase.dart`, `lib/domain/models/user.dart`

2. **Data**
    - Handles data operations and implements repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer. This layer is responsible for accessing data from various sources such as databases, network APIs, and cache.
    - **Components**: Repositories, data models, data sources (local and remote)
    - **Example**: `lib/data/repositories/user_repository_impl.dart`, `lib/data/datasources/user_remote_datasource.dart`

3. **Presentation**
    - Contains the UI logic and ViewModels. It’s the layer that interacts directly with the user and reflects the state changes in the Domain layer.
    - **Example**: `lib/presentation/viewmodels/user_viewmodel.dart`, `lib/presentation/views/login_screen.dart`

4. **Framework**
    - Encompasses platform-specific details and external libraries. This includes network configurations, dependency injection frameworks, and any other third-party libraries.
    - **Components**: Retrofit configurations, Dagger/Hilt modules, etc.
    - **Example**: `lib/framework/network/network_module.dart`, `lib/framework/di/app_module.dart`
